Map Area - Honolulu, Hawaii, United States
I have selected Honolulu as the city for the OpenStreetMaps project as I’ve visited the city many years ago and plan on going again in the near future. It is a beautiful city with a deep history and culture and a city I have enjoyed visiting. Below is a quick description of Honolulu from Wikipedia.

“Honolulu is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is an unincorporated part of and the county seat of the City and County of Honolulu on the island of Oahu.The city is the main gateway to Hawaii and a major portal into the United States. The city is also a major hub for international business, military defense, as well as famously being host to a diverse variety of east-west and Pacific culture, cuisine, and traditions.”
